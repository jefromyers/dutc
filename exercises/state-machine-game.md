# Exercise

Here are the rules:

- the game is started
- players have 90 seconds to request to join
- if within the first 60 seconds, only two players have requested joining,
  extend the clock by another 60 seconds (extend only three times, then
  cancel the game)
- each player has to be confirmed
- once the time elapses or five confirmed players join, the game immediately
  launches
- once the game launches, players submit guesses for the secret word; they are
  told whether they are right or wrong
- if a player guesses a word that a previous player has guessed, they are
  locked out for one second
- if a player guesses the correct word, then the game ends and that player wins
- players get 10 tries in total
- if no one has guessed within 120s or using all of their tries, the game ends
  and no one wins
